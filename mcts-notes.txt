Commands for running MCTSAgent:
python pacman.py -p MCTSAgent

Alright, it seems the simplest agent (with no computations whatsoever) can run only around 17 games per/sec

Real-time MCTS is out of the picture now.

[done] Migrate library MCTS from python 3 to 2
It was a pain though

Goal: survive
[done] Create a feature-based game state from the GameState (Make it reusable)
Write the classes required for library MCTS
